## Project description
#### Part 1
Used a suitable computer vision dataset to train a deep learning model. 
(i) Built and trained a deep learning model 
(ii) Train another deep learning model using transfer learning.
Compared and commented on the performance of both models.

#### Part 2
Used a twitter text sentiment data to build a deep learning text classifier model.
(i) Built and trained a deep learning text classifier model.
(ii) Train another deep learning model using transfer learning.
Compared and commented on the performance of both models.
